                The approach is similar in that KeelMate participants practice
                new skills, study new principles, and garner experience with
                real-world projects. KeelMate works to close knowledge gaps with
                learning and practical application of real-world skills.
                Coaches, where available, work alongside participants to guide
                them through the program, increasing their self confidence and
                expanding competencies. In some fields where we lack competence,
                but there is a significant number in need, we’ll offer the
                opportunity and challenge the community to learn together while
                practicing.
