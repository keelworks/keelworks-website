After pausing formal schooling in Bangladesh after 8th grade, I turned to self-directed learning while working remotely with international organizations like TED and KeelWorks. Now, as I prepare to study in the U.S. to earn both a high school diploma and an associate degree, I bring cultural adaptability, self-motivation, and a fresh, creative perspective to every team I join.

At KeelWorks, I’ve always felt respected, supported, and truly welcomed. The open-minded team creates a safe, empowering space where I’m encouraged to share ideas and grow. It’s not about where you come from—it’s about what you bring to the table. There’s no jealousy, competition, or negativity—just trust, encouragement, and collaboration.
