I knew I had to have a job after graduation, and that work in instructional design required experience. I needed help with design tools such as Captivate, Storyline, and Photoshop. I needed to be able to show samples of my work.”",

      "KeelWorks gave my resume legitimate experience. I learned to storyboard and build projects in Captivate using assets created in Photoshop and Audition. This experience was a boost to my confidence. More than creating work samples, I could now talk through instructional design tools and their features to prove my mastery. The Executive Director spoke to prospective employers, helped me with my resume, and advised me on the interview.",

At first, I was just trying to teach myself tools like Articulate and Camtasia. Really, I was just wasting my time. This volunteer opportunity is giving me valuable, practical, experience in creating courses and applying ID theory. The plus side is that the mission of this organization is admirable and something that will really help people who participate in our courses.
